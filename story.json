    "storyText": "The old manor stood at the edge of the village, its windows like hollow eyes staring into the void of night. Legends whispered of its last inhabitant, a reclusive artist who vanished decades ago, leaving behind only eerie paintings that seemed to watch you as you moved. On this stormy night, you feel an inexplicable pull to explore its decaying halls. Thunder rumbles overhead as you push the creaking door open, revealing a long, dust-covered corridor. The air is thick with the scent of mildew and something else—something metallic. As you step inside, the door slams shut behind you, echoing through the darkness. You hear a faint whispering, almost like a plea, drifting from deeper within the manor. You are not alone. \n\nWhat will you do next?",

    "storyText": "The echo of your voice fades into the shadows, swallowed by the oppressive silence of the manor. The whispering grows louder, a soft, haunting melody that seems to beckon you closer. You take a cautious step forward, the floorboards creaking underfoot. As you move deeper into the corridor, you notice the walls are lined with the artist's eerie paintings, their subjects twisting and contorting in ways that make your skin crawl. You can almost feel their eyes follow you, judging your every move. The air grows colder, and you shiver as another clap of thunder shakes the manor. You have to decide how to proceed. Will you follow the whispering, investigate one of the paintings, search for a way out, or call for help?",

    "storyText": "You follow the whispering, drawn deeper into the manor's shadowy depths. The melody wraps around you like a shroud, leading you to a dimly lit room at the end of the corridor. The walls are adorned with more of the artist's haunting works, but in the center of the room stands an easel, a blank canvas waiting for inspiration. As you step closer, the whispering intensifies, almost forming words. You can feel an ancient energy pulsing from the easel. Without thinking, you reach out to touch the canvas. Suddenly, visions flood your mind—glimpses of the artist's life, the loneliness, the madness. You see the moment they vanished, consumed by their own creations. The paintings around you shimmer and twist, revealing the trapped souls of those who had ventured here before. In that instant, you understand; the manor is a prison for lost spirits. As the storm rages outside, the whispering fades, leaving you alone with the chilling truth. You realize that you have become part of the legend, destined to wander these halls for eternity, a new painting in the artist's collection. The door behind you remains locked, and the darkness closes in.",
